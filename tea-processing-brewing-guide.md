# Tea Processing & Gong Fu Brewing Parameters Guide

This guide focuses on how processing methods directly influence optimal brewing parameters for gong fu style brewing, with specific examples for each category.

## White Teas

| Tea Name | Processing Method | Water Temp | Steeping Time (s) | Leaf Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Silver Needle (Bai Hao Yin Zhen), Moonlight White, Yunnan Silver Needle | Minimal processing, unwithered buds only | 70-75°C | 45, 60, 75, 90 | 4-5g/100ml | Downy buds require longer steeping time to extract flavors |
| White Peony (Bai Mu Dan), Gong Mei, New Vitality | Light withering, buds with young leaves | 75-85°C | 30, 45, 60, 75 | 4-5g/100ml | Mix of buds and leaves extracts more readily than Silver Needle |
| Aged Shou Mei (3+ years), Aged Gong Mei, Aged Wild White | Extended aging after minimal processing | 85-95°C | 20, 30, 45, 60 | 5-6g/100ml | Aging transforms chemistry, allowing higher temperatures |

**Processing Impact**: The minimal processing of white tea preserves delicate compounds. Aging causes natural oxidation that allows for higher brewing temperatures.

## Green Teas

| Tea Name | Processing Method | Water Temp | Steeping Time (s) | Leaf Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Gyokuro, Kabusecha, Shade-grown Tencha | Shade-grown (20+ days), steamed | 50-60°C | 60, 90, 120, 150 | 4-5g/100ml | Shading increases amino acids requiring very low temps to extract umami without bitterness |
| Long Jing (Dragonwell), Tai Ping Hou Kui, Liu An Gua Pian | Pan-fired, pressed flat | 75-85°C | 15, 25, 35, 45 | 3-4g/100ml | Pan-firing creates nutty notes that extract well at moderate temperatures |
| Sencha, Shincha, Asamushi Sencha | Steamed, rolled | 65-75°C | 30, 45, 60, 75 | 3-4g/100ml | Steaming preserves bright vegetable notes that extract at lower temperatures |
| Hojicha, Kyobancha, Aged Kukicha | Roasted bancha | 85-95°C | 30, 45, 60, 75 | 3-4g/100ml | Roasting creates caramelized notes that require higher temperatures |

**Processing Impact**: The method of fixing enzymes (steaming vs pan-firing) and any additional processing (shading, roasting) dramatically affects optimal brewing temperature.

## Yellow Teas

| Tea Name | Processing Method | Water Temp | Steeping Time (s) | Leaf Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Junshan Yinzhen, Huo Mountain Yellow Buds, Jun Shan Silver Needle | Withered, encased in wet cloth for "yellowing" | 75-85°C | 25, 35, 45, 55 | 3-4g/100ml | Yellowing reduces astringency, allowing slightly higher temperature than comparable green tea |
| Huoshan Huangya, Meng Ding Huang Ya, Huang Tang | Partially oxidized, with yellowing step | 75-85°C | 25, 35, 45, 55 | 3-4g/100ml | The partial "smothering" creates mellow character requiring precise temperature |
| Mengding Huangya, Mo Gan Huang Ya, Wen Shan Huang Ya | Wok-fried, then wrapped for yellowing | 80-85°C | 25, 35, 45, 55 | 3-4g/100ml | The wok-firing before yellowing creates more robustness, allowing for slightly higher temperature |

**Processing Impact**: The yellowing process reduces astringency found in green teas while maintaining delicate character, requiring precisely controlled moderate temperatures.

## Oolong Teas

| Tea Name | Processing Method | Water Temp | Steeping Time (s) | Leaf Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Ali Shan, Jin Xuan, Li Shan High Mountain | Light oxidation (15-20%), tight ball rolling | 85-90°C | 25, 35, 45, 55 | 5-7g/100ml | Light oxidation with tight rolling requires good temperature to "open" leaves |
| Wuyi Rock (Yan Cha), Shui Xian, Rou Gui | Medium oxidation (40-60%), strip style, medium roast | 90-95°C | 15, 25, 35, 45 | 5-6g/100ml | The roasting and oxidation creates robustness requiring higher temperature |
| Traditional Tie Guan Yin, Aged Dong Ding, Heavy-Roasted Bei Dou | Medium-high oxidation (50-70%), heavy roasting | 95-100°C | 20, 30, 45, 60 | 6-8g/100ml | Heavy roasting transforms chemistry, requiring full boiling water |
| Dan Cong (Phoenix), Mi Lan Xiang, Ya Shi Xiang | Medium oxidation (30-50%), strip style, fruity | 90-95°C | 15, 20, 30, 45 | 5-6g/100ml | Complex aromatics require quick initial steeps at high temperature to prevent astringency |

**Processing Impact**: Oxidation level and roasting degree are the primary determinants of brewing temperature, with rolling style affecting leaf ratio and steep time progression.

## Black Teas

| Tea Name | Processing Method | Water Temp | Steeping Time (s) | Leaf Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| First Flush Darjeeling, Nilgiri Frost Oolong, Himalayan First Flush | Light oxidation (70-80%), orthodox | 80-85°C | 15, 25, 35, 45 | 4-5g/100ml | Early spring harvest with light oxidation creates delicate character requiring lower temperature |
| Keemun, Yunnan Dian Hong, Jin Jun Mei | Full oxidation (90-100%), traditional small leaf | 90-95°C | 15, 30, 45, 60 | 4-5g/100ml | Full oxidation allows higher temperature without extracting excessive astringency |
| Assam CTC, Kenya CTC, Ceylon Dust | Full oxidation (95-100%), machine-processed | 95-100°C | 10, 15, 25, 35 | 3-4g/100ml | Broken leaf structure extracts very quickly, requiring shorter steeps |
| Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong, Tarry Lapsang Souchong, Russian Caravan | Full oxidation, pine-smoke dried | 95-100°C | 20, 30, 45, 60 | 4-5g/100ml | Smoking process transforms leaf chemistry, allowing high temperature brewing |

**Processing Impact**: Oxidation level and leaf integrity (whole vs. broken) are the primary determinants of optimal temperature and steeping time.

## Puerh Teas

**Processing Impact**: Degree of fermentation (either natural through aging or accelerated through wet piling) is the primary determinant of brewing temperature.

## Heicha (Dark Teas)

| Tea Name | Processing Method | Water Temp | Steeping Time (s) | Leaf Ratio | Notes |
|----------|------------------|------------|-------------------|------------|-------|
| Liu Bao, Guangxi Heicha, Three Cranes Liu Bao | Pile fermentation, basket aged | 95-100°C | 15, 25, 40, 60 | 5-7g/100ml | Fermentation process similar to shou puerh creates earthy character requiring high temperature |
| Fu Zhuan, An Hua Fu Brick, Golden Flowers Brick | Compressed, yellow mold fermentation | 95-100°C | 15, 25, 40, 60 | 5-7g/100ml | The "golden flowers" fungus contributes to unique character requiring full boiling water |
| Tian Jian, Hunan Dark Brick, Hei Jian | Fermented dark tea from Hunan | 95-100°C | 15, 25, 40, 60 | 5-7g/100ml | Regional variation of heicha with similar robust fermentation character |

**Processing Impact**: Post-fermentation processes create robust profiles requiring high brewing temperatures.

## Advanced Processing Considerations

### Withering Impact
- **Extended Withering**: Creates more floral notes, often requiring slightly lower brewing temperatures to preserve these aromatics. Example: Oriental Beauty (60-70% withered)
- **Minimal Withering**: Preserves fresh, vegetal characteristics. Example: Japanese greens with no withering

### Firing Method Impact
- **Charcoal Firing**: Creates deeper, more complex roast notes requiring higher temperatures. Example: Traditional Wuyi Yan Cha
- **Electric Roasting**: Creates cleaner, more consistent roast notes. Example: Modern Taiwanese oolongs
- **Repeated Roasting**: Multiple roasting sessions create layered complexity requiring higher brewing temperatures. Example: Aged, re-roasted Dong Ding

### Aging Impact
- **Dry Storage Aging**: Slower transformation, more woody notes. Example: Malaysian-stored raw puerh
- **Wet Storage Aging**: Faster transformation, more earthy notes. Example: Hong Kong-stored raw puerh
- **Periodic Re-Roasting**: Manages moisture and refreshes tea during aging. Example: Aged oolong

## The Role of Cultivar
Some cultivars have distinct processing requirements that affect brewing:

- **Jin Xuan (Cultivar #12)**: Naturally creamy character, benefits from lower temperature even when processed as oolong (85-88°C)
- **Ruby #18**: Red jade black tea with natural cinnamon notes, benefits from lower temperature than typical black teas (85-90°C)
- **Da Ye Qing**: Large leaf cultivar used for puerh, naturally bitter requiring careful temperature management when young (85°C)

## Seasonal Variations
For the same tea, seasonal harvest affects optimal brewing:

- **Spring Harvest**: Most delicate, often requiring 5°C lower brewing temperature
- **Summer Harvest**: Most robust, can handle standard or slightly higher brewing temperature
- **Autumn Harvest**: Balanced character, follows standard brewing temperature guidelines
